Obsidian Obsidian URI links \u00b6 [[Using obsidian URI|Obsidian URI]] links can be used to open notes in Obsidian either from another Obsidian vault or another program. For example, you can link to a file in a vault like so (please note the [[Using obsidian URI#Encoding|required encoding]]): [ Link to note ]( obsidian://open?path=D:%2Fpath%2Fto%2Ffile.md ) Link to note You can link to a note by its vault name and file name instead of path as well: [ Link to note ]( obsidian://open?vault=MainVault&file=MyNote.md ) Link to note Escaping \u00b6 If there are spaces in the url, they can be escaped by either using %20 as a space, such as: [ Export options ]( Pasted%20image ) Export options Or you can enclose the target in <> , such as: [ Slides Demo ]( <Slides Demo> ) Slides Demo Blockquotes \u00b6 > Human beings face ever more complex and urgent problems, and their effectiveness in dealing with these problems is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued progress of society. \\- Doug Engelbart, 1961 Human beings face ever more complex and urgent problems, and their effectiveness in dealing with these problems is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued progress of society. - Doug Engelbart, 1961 Inline code \u00b6 Text inside `backticks` on a line will be formatted like code.
